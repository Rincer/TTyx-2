// Heap allocator. 
// Allocates a large block of memory from either the OS or main heap. The 1st 4k of that memory are used for internal structures.
// The implementation is based on Doug Lea memory manager. Free block bins are grouped by size. Small block bins go from 0 bytes per block to 508 bytes per block in 4 byte increments.
// Large block bins start from 512 bytes per block and go up to 2^31 bytes per block where each successive block is twice the size of its predecessor. Each block contains header data, 
// which is immediately followed by user data. Header data contains user data size, and 32 bit offsets from the beginning of allocated memory block. m_PrevInMemory is the offset of the 
// block that precedes the current block in memory. m_PrevInBin and m_NextInBin are offsets of previous and next block in the free block bins. An offset of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates that there 
// is no previous or next block.
// When Alloc is called a search is performed to find the smallest size bin that has free blocks bigger than the required allocation size. The first block in the bin is used to do the allocation.
// If the block size if bigger than the required allocation size, it is split into 2 blocks. The 1st one matches the size exactly and is used for the allcation while the remainder is
// added to the free block pool.
// When Free is called a check is performed if the previous in memory or the next in memory blocks are free then they are merged into the block being freed and added back to the
// free block pool.
